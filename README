Program Description:

This program lets you watch almost any TV show from tv-links.eu. After entering the 
season/episde/link, it will open up the show directly for you in your browser.


To use program:

Enter TV show when prompted. If TV show is not in database, it will search for the 
tv show on the website and ask if it is correct then add to database.

Pick season/episode

When it asks for what host you want, you can choose hosts such as: "putlocker, 
megavideo, sockshare, ovfile, zshare etc." or just leave it blank to show all of 
them.

It will then list out numbers on the very left, a code, percentage of how good users 
rated the link, then the host.

Type the number on the very left of whichever link you want. It will then open up 
the hosts website and play the specified show.

NOTE: If you enter a show and nothing shows up and it just asks you to enter a show 
again, that means the show does not exist! Try using the full name of the show 
(A very common mistake is forgertring to include "the")
